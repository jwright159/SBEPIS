This project is still in development, but we migrated to Unity Version Control, which, do to *weirdness*, can't sync with GitHub, so we're archiving this until further notice. If you would like access to the project source code, to submit a bug, or just to engage in the community, come over to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/qHREQu7Zxm) and notify one of the developers.
